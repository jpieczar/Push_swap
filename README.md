This is my Push_swap. This is a programme that I wrote which sorts a list of numbers (Insertion sort).
For this project, I was restricted with the type of moves  that I can make and the number of them. It sorts 100 numbers in under 900 moves and 500 numbers in under 8500 moves.

PLEASE USE FIX_Push_Swap_Fix.

To compile, go into the appropriate folder and type "make done".
To run, use ./checker "insert numbers here" or ./push_swap "insert numbers here".
